# A-deeper-dive-into-Flutter-UI
Trying some new skills, focusing on more functional UI components.
In this repository I have uploaded the apps which I had made recently to test out my skills on more functional UI Components.
Some of these apps represent single features like Rotaion Lock, Firebase & Firestore Connectivity, various sign-in methods, etc.
While some are full fledged pages like Login Screen, Profile Screen, etc.
